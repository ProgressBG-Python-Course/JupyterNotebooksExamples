    "### Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance is a measure of dispersion (like range, mean, median, ...), meaning it is a measure of how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value. High variance signifies that dataset values are far from their mean. On the other side, low variance signifies that the values are very close to their mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics sample variance is denoted by $s^2$ as the variance is the square of the standard deviation - a mesure most commonly used. The basic difference between both is that standard deviation is represented in the same units as the mean of data, while the variance is represented in squared units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample variance is calculated as the average of the squared differences from the mean.\n",
