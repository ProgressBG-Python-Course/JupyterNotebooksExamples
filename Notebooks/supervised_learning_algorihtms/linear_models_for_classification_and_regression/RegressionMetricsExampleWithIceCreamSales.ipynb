    "### Interpretation\n",
    "- **MAE**: The average absolute error is 10 ice creams. This means, on average, our predictions are off by 10 ice creams.\n",
    "- **MSE**: The average of the squared errors is 100. Since the errors are squared, this value can be harder to interpret directly compared to MAE and RMSE.\n",
    "- **RMSE**: The average error, considering the original scale of the data, is 10 ice creams. This provides a more intuitive measure of prediction error, similar to MAE but with more weight given to larger errors.\n",
    "- **R-squared**: An R-squared value of approximately 0.9914 means that about 99.14% of the variability in ice cream sales can be explained by the model. The remaining 0.86% of the variability is due to other factors not included in the model.\n"
